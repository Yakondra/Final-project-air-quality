**Hazardous level of atmospheric pollutants🌍🔍**.
---
![Logo](polucion.jpg)

## *Project Description*

This project aims to predict the hazard level of various atmospheric pollutants as a function of different variables, such as the type of area in which it is located and the surrounding environmental factors. Hazard level prediction is essential to understand and mitigate potential risks associated with exposure to pollutants at different locations.


## *Main objective:*

This project is important because it allows predicting and understanding air pollution levels to:

- Protect public health.
- Facilitate sustainable urban planning.
- Improve people's quality of life.
- Promote environmental awareness.
- Contribute to scientific research in air quality.

## *Description of the Data* 📈

Data are from the official website of the Government of Spain, Ministry for Ecological Transition and Demographic Challenge.

Data collected from the documentation of the page were introduced to obtain some data to help us develop the purpose of our project.

## *Principal Characteristics*

- FECHA. Date recorded at the time the pollutant values were taken (numeric).
- N_CCAA. Name of each autonomous community in Spain where measurement data were collected for each pollutant (categorical).
- PROVINCIA. Name of each province in which measurement data for each pollutant were collected (categorical).
- N_MUNICIPIO. Name of each municipality in which measurement data were collected for each pollutant (categorical).
- ESTACION. Number assigned to each station in each autonomous community that has recorded pollutant measurement data (numeric).
- MAGNITUD. Each pollutant that has been registered in the different stations (categorical).
- TIPO_AREA.Type of area in which they are located, urban, suburban or rural area (categorical).
- TIPO_ESTACION. According to the typology of the main emission source, traffic, industrial or background (categorical).
- LATITUD, LONGITUD. Geographical data of each station where pollutants have been recorded (numeric).
- H01, H02, H03.... H24. Hourly recorded value for each pollutant. All pollutants are taken with unified measurement units (µg/m3) (numeric).

## *Pollutants* 🏭💨🚗

> All concentration data are expressed in micrograms per cubic meter (μg/m³).
